# About Me

I’m interested in spatial data, demographics, and social impact, using data to better understand social trends and inform decision making. You can find some of my personal projects in the [projects](/projects/) page. 

My journey into data analytics wasn't a straightforward path. It started with a passion for people, education, and understanding the world through different perspectives. I studied BA History and Politics at university, which first sparked my interest in analysing societal trends, with my dissertation exploring the changing cultural landscape of the US and the challenges to American exceptionalism in the post-Vietnam War era, through the lense of Vietnam War films. After graduating, I moved to Vietnam to teach English, eventually becoming a regional headteacher at a language school in Hanoi.

In 2021, I returned to the UK and joined [ReachOut](https://www.reachoutuk.org/), an education and mentoring charity dedicated to helping young people build confidence, resilience, and meaningful mentor relationships. It was in this role that I became increasingly drawn to data, seeing its potential to inform delivery and measure impact. This led me to pursue an MSc in Data Analytics, where I’ve explored a wide-range of topics in the social sciences such as the impact of nature on well-being, barriers to accessing green spaces, and demographics and mortality trends.

Beyond my studies, I’m also a Non-Executive Director of [Grow with Hope](https://www.growwithhope.org.uk/), a young person’s mental health charity here in the North West. Here, I support the organization in using data effectively, developing stakeholder surveys to better understand the needs of schools and ensure our delivery is responsive and evidence-based.

In my spare time, I enjoy [photography](/photography/), board games and hiking with my dog, Reggie, in the Peak District.
